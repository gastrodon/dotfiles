  - `disk` - Disk usage monitoring
  - `empty_workspace` - Workspace management
  - `keyboard-layout` - Keyboard layout indicator
  - `keyhint`, `keyhint-2` - Keyboard shortcut hints
  - `openweather`, `openweather-city`, `openweather.conf` - Weather information
  - `power-profiles` - Power profile management
  - `ppd-status` - Power profile daemon status

## Key Configuration Areas

### Window Manager Settings
- Font: iosevka term ss04
- Modifier key: Mod4 (Windows/Super key)
- Workspace layout: default (can be stacking or tabbed)
- Window decorations and borders
- Floating window rules
- Workspace assignments for specific applications

### Keybindings
- Standard i3 window management keybindings
- Application launchers (rofi, terminal)
- Window movement and resizing
- Workspace switching
- Volume and brightness controls
- Screenshot utilities
- System controls (lock, logout, restart, shutdown)

### Autostart Applications
- Compositor (picom or compton)
- Network manager applet
- Polybar or i3bar
- Notification daemon (dunst)
- System tray applications
- Background setter (feh or nitrogen)

### Status Bar (i3blocks)
- Custom blocklets for system information
- Integration with helper scripts
- Update intervals and signal handling

### Helper Scripts
- Battery monitoring for different hardware
- Screen locking with visual effects
- System resource monitoring
- Weather integration
- VPN status display
- Keyboard layout switching
- Power management

## Home Manager Integration Points
- xsession.windowManager.i3.enable for main configuration
- xsession.windowManager.i3.config for declarative configuration
- xsession.windowManager.i3.extraConfig for additional settings
- home.packages for i3-related utilities
- systemd.user.services for background services
- home.file for script deployment

## Dependencies
- i3-wm or i3-gaps - Window manager
- i3blocks or i3status - Status bar
- rofi - Application launcher
- picom or compton - Compositor for transparency/effects
- feh or nitrogen - Wallpaper setter
- dunst - Notification daemon
- scrot or maim - Screenshot utilities
- i3lock or i3lock-color - Screen locker
- imagemagick - For blur effects in lock script
- Font: iosevka term ss04
- playerctl - Media player control
- pulseaudio or pipewire - Audio system
- NetworkManager - Network management
- acpi or sysfs - Battery information
- Optional: power-profiles-daemon for power management

## Notes
- The configuration appears to be based on EndeavourOS i3 setup
- Many scripts may have hardcoded paths that need adjustment
- Weather scripts require API keys (openweather.conf)
- Battery scripts may need hardware-specific adjustment
- Consider whether to use i3bar with i3blocks or switch to polybar (separate module exists)
- Screen locking script may require specific imagemagick commands
- Some scripts may depend on system-specific tools (acpi, sysfs interfaces)
- Ensure all scripts are executable when deployed
- Consider converting shell scripts to Nix where appropriate for better portability
